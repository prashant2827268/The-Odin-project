Today, i leaned about debugging out of context.
I learned how to use the vs code debugger.
When i encounters some problem in my code I use console.log() many times, and it reduces the efficiency.
So i searched the youtube and find out some cool visoes which taught me about how to use vs code debugger for nodejs
I learned two type of methods. 1. launch.json method  2. Javascript debugger
I encountered various issues, like the debugger sometime entering the node internals, so i asked chatgpt why it is moving in those parts, after that i found the solution and it was like add node internals to your launch file
